      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Adam Samuelson!
        I'm a computer science student at the University of Texas at Austin
        and I'm a STEP intern with

      <h2>My Ambitions</h2>
      <p>
        From a young age, I knew that I wanted to write code that helps people.
        While taking a class called "Youth and Technology" my fist semester of college,
        I wrote a research paper called "Youth and Technology Addiction". 
        This research paper showed me how problematic smartphone usage (especially among youth) can cause
        things such as depression and anxiety.
        This led me to deicde I want my focus in computer science to be on reducing the negative effects
        technology can have on our wellbeing. Technology should propel us forward, not hold us back.
