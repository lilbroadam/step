      <h2>My Ambitions</h2>
      <p>
        From a young age, I knew that I wanted to write code that helps people.
        While taking a class called "Youth and Technology" my fist semester of college,
        I wrote a research paper called "Youth and Technology Addiction". 
        This research paper showed me how problematic smartphone usage (especially among youth) can cause
        things such as depression and anxiety.
        This led me to deicde I want my focus in computer science to be on reducing the negative effects
        technology can have on our wellbeing. Technology should propel us forward, not hold us back.
      </p>

      <h2>Photography Gallery</h2>
      <p>
        Somehow I kind of ended up getting into photography (or maybe I just like taking
        pictures of campus).
        All of these pictures I took on a Google Pixel XL except for 2 that were taken on
        a Google Pixel 4 XL üì∏ Can you tell which ones? üßê
